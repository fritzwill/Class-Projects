	This program is meant to give the user the area of a triangle given
	the length of all 3 sides of the triangle. The program utilize Heron's
	Formula which states Area = sqrt(s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) where s=(a+b+c)/2
	and a, b, and c are the lengths of each side of the triangle. The 
	program is structured by taking 3 user inputs and using them to 
	calculate the area of the specific triangle. I evaluated the program
	for corectness by calculating the area of the triangle uing my own
	calculations and by usin online "Heron Formula Calculators". This
	is how I verified that the program produced correct results. It 
	produces incorrect results when teh sides entered in does not produce
	a possible triangle.
