Overall, good job! Check comments below for tips!

saylist.cpp 17/20
    -2 save does not work properly. It creates the file but the contents are not in it when it is opened. 
    -1 Need to make sure that saying exists before you try to delete it.
    Resorting the sayings every time a new saying is inserted is inefficient. This has an efficiency of O(n^2). You can insert a saying in O(n) time by traversing the linked list and inserting the saying once you find where it fits alphabetically.

letterfreq.cpp 18/20
    -2 Whitespace percentage is incorrect because of integer division. You need to cast either spaces or totalchar to a float. E.g:
        float percentspace = ((float)spaces/totalchar)*100;

    Awesome formatting!
    The program should print out the full number for letters and characters instead of using notation like this: 3.4933e+06
    If you index each letter value by subtracting 'A' first, then counter only needs to have a length of 26, which saves space.
