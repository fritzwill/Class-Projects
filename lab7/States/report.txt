Internally, the program creates a vector of States which is a user made class. This vector is then used in multiple functions so that certain contents can be displayed given inputs by the user.

From the user's perspective, they are give 6 choices. Each one displays states given certain criteria that they are asked to give. The final option is to quit the program. 

I testted for erros by running each function and seeing if the output was what I wanted it to be.
